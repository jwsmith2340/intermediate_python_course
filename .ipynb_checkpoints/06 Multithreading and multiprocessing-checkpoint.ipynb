To remedy this, we **must** convert the concurrent access into **serial** access by **locking** the resource. **Serial** access ensures that at any one time, only one thread is accessing the resource. In a way, this does limit multithreading, but we must prevent access to a resource at any given time by other threads to prevent race conditions.\n",
